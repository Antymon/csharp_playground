Playing with classic CS course algorithms for educational purposes

Most have some simplistic tests.

I try to comment stuff and give some info on complexity/features.

For production-quality algorithms search for some cutting-edge, state-of-art libraries*


So far in the little zoo:

- Kadane
- Kadeane 2D
- Palindromes
- Matrix Chain Multiplication
- Longest Common Subsequence
- Optimal binary search tree
- Cutting Rod
- Knapsack problem
- Fibonacci numbers
- Bubble Sort
- Merge Sort
- Parallel Merge Sort
- Counting Sort

...

* Efficient solutions these days usually have complex answers.
  For example Matrix Chain Multiplication here is a DP problem with O(n^3) complexity.
  There existis triangulation-based Shing-Hu algorithm of O(nlgn) complexity
